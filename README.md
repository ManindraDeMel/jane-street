# Jane Street ETC ~ 2024 Ultra Traders

## Overview
Participated in the Jane Street Electronic Trading Challenge, our team embarked on a journey to explore various trading strategies within a simulated electronic financial market. Throughout the competition, we experimented with bonds, arbitrage, and market making strategies. Despite facing challenges, particularly with the arbitrage between VAL and VALZ and executing effective market making, we achieved a respectable 10th place finish.

## Strategies Explored

### 1. Bonds Trading
Our initial foray into the competition focused on bonds trading. By analyzing the market data and applying our quantitative models, we successfully implemented a bonds trading strategy that contributed significantly to our early gains in the competition. We were one of the first teams to deploy this strategy and as a result we were in 2nd place for the first two hours (I would recommend starting with this strategy in the future)

### 2. Arbitrage: VAL and VALZ
One of our primary strategies involved exploiting arbitrage opportunities between VAL and VALZ. However, we encountered challenges with the convert method's inconsistency and our inability to accurately track our positions. Despite our best efforts, these issues prevented us from fully capitalizing on this strategy.

### 3. Market Making
As the competition progressed, we shifted our focus to market making in an attempt to capture bid-ask spreads and enhance liquidity. However, this strategy did not yield the results we anticipated, partly due to the intense competition and our execution strategy.

### 4. Lessons Learned
The importance of precise position tracking and the impact of system limitations on strategy execution.
Adapting to market conditions and competitor strategies is crucial for success.
Theoretical strategies require rigorous testing and may need adjustment when applied in real-time, competitive environments.
Competition Outcome

#### Final Placement: 10th Place

### Winning Strategy Observation: 
We observed that the winning team employed a "pennying" strategy, which involves slightly outbidding competitors on buy orders and undercutting on sell orders, effectively capturing the spread. This approach underscored the importance of agility and precision in execution within the competition's framework.

### Future Directions
In light of our experiences and the insights gained from this competition, our team is keen on refining our strategies, with particular emphasis on:

Developing more robust methods for tracking positions and handling data inconsistencies.
Exploring new algorithms for market making and arbitrage that can adapt to dynamic market conditions.
Incorporating machine learning techniques to predict market movements and optimize our trading strategies.
Acknowledgements
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to Jane Street for organizing this stimulating competition, and to all our team members for their dedication and hard work.
